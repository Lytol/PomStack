Description: PomStack
        ========
        
        Create a stack of Pomodoros to do at the beginning of each day, and pull them off the stack to complete them!
        
        
        Feature Ideas
        -------------
        
        - Setup recurring Pomodoros (every day, weekdays, or specific days)
        - Pomodoro timer in the site (start and stop poms from the site)
        - API to use with tools like the Mac Pomodoro timer
        - Tag and categorize pomodoros (work, project, etc)
        
        
        Revenue Model
        -------------
        
        - I love the $12/yr price point!
        - Fuck freemium, free 30-day trial seems appropriate
