PomStack
========

Create a stack of Pomodoros to do at the beginning of each day, and pull them off the stack to complete them!

TODO
----

* Add new pomodoros (inline)
* Delete existing pomodoros (inline)
* Edit existing pomodoros (inline)
* Copy pomodoros (inline)
* Start a pomodoro
* Set pomodoro as recurring

Feature Ideas
-------------

- Setup recurring Pomodoros (every day, weekdays, or specific days)
- Pomodoro timer in the site (start and stop poms from the site)
- API to use with tools like the Mac Pomodoro timer
- Tag and categorize pomodoros (work, project, etc)


Revenue Model
-------------

- I love the $12/yr price point!
- Fuck freemium, free 30-day trial seems appropriate
